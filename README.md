Pyppy Adventure is a graphical simulation written in the Python programming language which
simulates the interaction of the agent (dog) with the environment. The dog moves around the map of different fields and
his goal is to get to his house in the most optimal way. The simulation can end
by the arrival of the dog to the house (successful) or by falling into the hole (unsuccessful).
The movement of the dog is made using reinforcement learning with Q-learning algorithm implemented in Python.
